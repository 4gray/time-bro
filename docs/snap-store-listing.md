## Description

Yesterlog is a local-first work memory for developers who use Jira.

Connect your Jira Cloud account with a regular Atlassian API token and Yesterlog
turns the work evidence you already leave behind into a record you can use.
Review and complete worklogs without living in Jira's timesheet screens, find
missing days, and keep Monday-local totals, daily targets, ticket history,
recurring events, reports, and personal notes in one focused desktop workspace.

Day Reconstruction can rebuild a forgotten workday from Jira worklogs and
optional Bitbucket commits and pull-request review activity. Its deterministic
core works without AI. Recap uses the same grounded local history to draft a
standup, manager update, performance review, CV candidate, or changelog for a
week, month, or quarter, with links back to the supporting sources and a local
brag doc for saved snapshots.

If you enable the optional AI layer, choose Ollama for fully local processing,
Anthropic through the Claude CLI, or OpenAI through the Codex CLI. The cloud
options use your existing CLI authentication and receive best-effort-redacted
signals. Yesterlog has no hosted backend or telemetry.

Highlights:

- Reconstruct forgotten days from Jira and optional Bitbucket activity.
- Add, edit, and delete Jira worklogs from the intentional time-entry flow.
- Turn a week, month, or quarter into a grounded recap for standups, managers,
  performance reviews, CV drafts, or changelogs.
- Inspect recap sources, compare versions, export drafts, and save a local brag doc.
- Search Jira tickets and keep frequently used work close at hand.
- Review reports, daily targets, recurring events, and local personal notes.
- Import and export weekly CSV data.
- Keep credentials and synced data on your own device.
- No Yesterlog account, hosted backend, telemetry, or cloud AI requirement.

Yesterlog is an independent application and is not affiliated with or endorsed
by Atlassian.
